            <span>
                "Lord of the Mysteries" follows Zhou Mingrui, a modern Chinese man, who reincarnates as Klein Moretti in a steampunk-inspired Victorian-era world with supernatural powers. This world features machinery, potions, and a system of Beyonder paths, where individuals can gain supernatural abilities through specific rituals and potion consumption. Klein, now in this alternate world, seeks to find a way back to his original home while unraveling the mysteries of his transmigration and the supernatural world he finds himself in.
